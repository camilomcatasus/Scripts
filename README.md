## ScreenShotBook
Used for taking screenshots of a piece of text that is not easily converted to a file, do not use this tool if you plan on reselling or redistributing a book without permission of the copyright owner. 
### How it works
Will take user input on how many pages X the user wishes to screen shot. The program sleeps for five seconds to allow the user to bring the window that holds the text into focus, then takes a screen shot and presses the right arrow button to change pages X number of times.
